It would be a cheap and efficient alternative to travelling where the individual would be picked up from their homes and taken to their required location using a highway put in place for these vehicles.<br>

                    <br>3. An autonomous public transport system with multiple options where you can choose to be picked up sooner and dropped off a little walk away, or wait longer and be dropped off out the front of the location. There would be many of these vehicles around the city that would all communicate with each other to find the best route for the individual.</p>

Sophie gave us good feedback and told us that our idea was too close to a solution and we needed to step back. As a result, we decided to expand our problem area and change our focus. To do this, Benjie and Nathan researched the Greenâ€™s political policies to find out current issues in our state and did some more mindmapping.<br></p>

After some discussion and last brainstorming of problem spaces, we ended up choosing Domestic Violence.<br><br>We then made another stakeholder map for this new issue and discussed who each person would be focusing on for the research:</p>

                      <p class="center-text">I wanted to focus on victims initially, seeing as Benjie was focusing on social workers and Nathan on police. After considering how I was going to be able to do that, I decided it would be too difficult to talk to victims because of its sensitivity and it would be hard to find people. As a result, looking at refuges would be a more realistic and still valuable area.<br><br>After going from such a simple idea, to something I knew nothing about, I was worried about how I was going to research it and gather information. It felt like a really difficult issue to tackle at first but I knew that choosing a more complex idea would be better in the long run.<br></p>
