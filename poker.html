                    <p class="text-left">I began by collecting data for every liquor and gambling club in Sydney that
                        had poker machines. This included information about how many machines they had and in what
                        locations. I then geocoded each club so I could plot them on a map. </p>

                    <p class="text-left">To find out whether the number of poker machines per club had a correlation
                        with a suburbs socio-economic status, I needed overlay this information on top of Socio-Economic
                        Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) data. In order to do this I obtained the shapefile of suburbs in NSW
                        and merged them with this data. </p>

                    <p class="text-left">One great application to help me do this was QGIS, a tool to create, visualise
                        and analyse geospatial data. I used this to visualise the range of advantaged and disadvantaged
                        suburbs in NSW. I imported the shapefile and combined it with the SEIFA data to make a visible
                        choropleth that I could lay it against my other data. </p>

                    <p class="text-left">I used an online map visualising tool called Carto to quickly plot the number
                        of poker machines that were at each club. The larger and darker the circle, the more machines.
                        Initially it was not clear whether there was something significant being shown here. There were
                        so many points on a map, that were scattered all over Sydney. </p>

                    <p class="text-left"> It wasn’t until I added the choropleth layer that the results became
                        interesting. The darker red, or more disadvantaged suburbs, had a larger cluster of points. This
                        showed that the more socio-economically disadvantaged suburbs do actually have a larger number
                        of poker machines in the area. </p>

                        This data was interesting, but how could it be made more meaningful? To get a more
                        representative number I had to look at the population of each area. I collected data of the net
                        profit of each club in their Local Governement Area (LGA), as there was not this data avaliable
                        for each suburb. This meant that it would not work with the shapefile I already processed and I
                        would need to make another one for LGA’s. I went back into QGIS, gathered the new data and
                        combined each LGA with their respective SEIFA score. </p>

                        I had the datasets, and now I wanted to see what existing map visualisations were out there. I
                        wanted to discover what design choices people made and how the interaction could be enhanced.
                        Color Brewer was a great resource for what color schemes to follow, and how they could be used
                        to help distinguish different regions from each other. It was important to be able to view all
                        like colours on a screen without confusing them with each other. Most maps I looked at had a
                        choropleth visualisation, others had only points on a map, and I needed to combine both.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-left">After researching several interactive visualisations, I decided upon the best
                        way I could visualize my data on a map and the colour schemes I could use. Reds and oranges were
                        used when representing negative or dangerous situations. Pink was used in the representation of
                        lighter-hearted topics. Blue and green were commonly used in social or economic related maps.
                        They all communicate their messages effectively. </p>

                        The first step was finding the best base map. The base map needed to be a neutral colour to lay
                        the foundation of the choropleth that would be on top. Carto provided a few default colours of
                        which I chose the grey one as no other colours were really necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-left">
                        The next step was adding the shapefile data on top. The blue colours represent the
                        socio-economic status - the darker the area, the more disadvantaged.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-left">
                        Finally, I added the poker machine data as points. One problem I came across was the accuracy of
                        the location of the dots, some of them had to be moved manually because the API I used had found
                        slightly incorrect coordinates for some areas. I looked online for the coordinates of the
                        inaccurate areas and edited the excel file accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-left">
                        After making the maps in Carto, I explored other tools online to achieve a similar goal. A great
                        one I found for easily making and sharing maps is Kepler, a program created by Uber to help
                        people create interactive map visualisations.
