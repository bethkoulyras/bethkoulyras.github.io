                <p class="center-text">I began drawing up sketches for the next iteration of the Bus. I followed what I had done in my previous sketches - the horizontal scrolling etc. and really fleshed them out in this design. I was looking forward to being able to test how this went. I was concerned that I hadn’t included all the necessary things. For example, I wasn’t sure if there were any other icons that needed to be there,  but I ended up sticking with what I already had and rely on feedback that I would receive from Benjie and Nathan and any other participants that might test it out.<br><br>

                    <p>For the app, I wanted to look at Uber and other ride-sharing apps to see why their interfaces were so successful. I played around with Uber and Ola at first, both were quite similar to each other and pretty straightforward. I was in the middle of moving house and I was using the GoGet app. I noticed how the map wasn’t a central part of the screen. There were two tabs, one for scheduling the different vehicles you could get in your area, and the other was a map version if you chose to view it that way. The was more focused on scheduling rather than instant ordering. But it gave detailed information about how far away a vehicle was, how big it was, the time it would take to get to it and bar for how long you needed it for. Some of this information would be useful for my design.</p>

                        <p class="center-text"><br>I implemented a slide up card that pops up every time information needed to be entered: how many days, how many people etc. It would also display the information about what bus was coming, how long it would be. I decided to keep the map on the main display because I figured the user would want constant feedback on that.</p>

                            <p class="center-text">I wanted to find the right people to test my design on. I had access to two people that either are or have been in a long term relationship. My design focused on victims, but it is possible for anyone to be a victim so therefore it was not difficult to find people to test. The important thing was that they were in long term relationship as that is the only predicator to domestic violence. The first think alouds, I used a screen recording. After I recorded I realised it did not show where they pressed on the screen. The kind of rendered the recording useless as it would have been good to see where they pressed if it was incorrect. I guess that is the point of the think alouds, by recording their voices it should provide us with enough information.<br> 
                                    <br>I followed this up with a short interview about the interface. I wanted to gather this information so that I could get more thoughts about the rest of the interface that may have not been covered in the think alouds. This gave me more insights into whether the icons were recognisable enough and whether they could understand different aspects of the screen. For example, the participants showed some confusion about the ‘Scheduled’ section of the home screen, but I wanted to find out whether they understood why it could be there and it turns out, they didn’t. This was my first time doing think alouds so I wasn’t too sure of what to expect. I learnt through this process that it can be very valuable. There were so many things I realised I could change. I got conflicting outcomes, one of my participants found the icons better and the other liked the text.<br>

                                    <br>I reflected on the things I needed to change in the next iteration. I thought about adding an info button next to the scheduled heading. I though about changing the ‘Services’ icon to a files folder and changing a few of the other icons. The first click on the sidebar would bring up file names and the second click would take you to the page. This seemed to be a waste of a click so I need to figure out a way that can better present what each icon is. The only thing is I’m really not keen to add text onto the icons, I want to have it as something separate, but I don’t know if it’s going to work given how ambiguous the icons seem.<br>
                                    
                                    <br>Our group met up to show each other our next iterations of designs and share our insights from the think aloud testing. This was the moment we had to decide on what idea we wanted to run with. We discussed how the Office Assistant is good but would not be very interesting to design for as it would be a lot of forms and applications. The maintenance cart, while it solved important issues, would be complex and could not quite compete with the resolution that the Bus provided. After a short discussion we quite easily mutually agreed to go with the Secure Housing Bus. It would be most interesting, the best to solve our user needs, and the most practical and thought out idea.<br>

                   <br>After deciding on our idea, we looked at Benjie’s Housing Bus app and my interface and discussed what we could do to improve them and what tasks we would want people to perform with our next iteration. We thought about how living in a bus, you would want to change the environment, for example, lights and air conditioning. It started to turn more into an interface not only to solve problems for victims but treating it like a normal in-car interface. From this, we researched other in-car interfaces that already existed. We watched some videos of people walking through the Tesla interface and I learnt a lot from this. There were many features and settings that went way beyond what I had originally thought about an in-car interface being. One Tesla interface had a split screen between a car image and the map. The car gave the user feedback with things like when the doors were opened and closed. This gave us the idea of a displaying a constant feedback loop, but instead of different things happening inside the car, it would provide the user a view of the outside of the car and its surrounding environment. This would then help the user to feel safe as they know what is going on around them. We talked about creating quick controls that pop up where the user can change basic settings, and having the ability to click into more settings where you can adjust more finer details.<br>
                   <br>We distributed the work and decided I would do the in-bus interface, Benjie would do the app to order the bus and Nathan would work on a concept drawing of the bus.<br> </p>
