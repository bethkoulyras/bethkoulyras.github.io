                <p class="center-text">The second iteration required me to completely rethink and redesign the interface. I decided to move the nav bar to the bottom as I now needed more options and having it on the side would not allow enough room. I added in different controls that could be changed like the air conditioning, the lights and the windows. There would still be an ‘About Bus’ icon that took you to information about the bus. I wanted to do a split screen similar to what we had seen on the Tesla vehicles. The interface had quick controls that could expand into further control by selecting the ‘adjust settings’ button. </p>

                    <p><br>I thought this interface was much better than the previous one. There were all these things I hadn’t thought of before that I realised I needed to add. Now it was more like other in-car interfaces you see but also tailored to the Secure Housing Bus. I gave much more control to the user as they may be living in this bus for a few days and require to change certain settings around the ambience of the bus. Also, I’ve put everything into the Marvel app for the second time, and this time I made cut outs of all the other screens that pop up above the map. Benjie had done this for his app, and it cut down the time it took him to do it. This made it so much easier to take photos and have multiple different screens, rather than drawing up a new screen for every little change.<br> 

                        <br>For my second round of think alouds I made a video recording this time to observe what the participants were doing. The problems were immediate. The ‘Window’ icon was unrecognisable by most participants. The quick controls were confusing at first, but in the end people managed to understand what was going on. The major thing was more clarity needed to be made with the icons. Almost every participant mentioned they would have preferred text underneath the icons.

Very quickly I saw the value of think aloud testing. I found this round to be much more effective than the previous one. I guess this is because there were more screens and things were fleshed out a bit more.
