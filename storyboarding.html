The problem I am trying to solve is for women who are living in refuges and have come from low socio-economical or uneducated background. This storyboard seeks to portray the benefits a victim could have from a service that helps them to build up on specific skills in order to help them get jobs in the future.<br>

We sought feedback from our tutor who gave us some valuable ideas, things we could change and things that had potential. We also asked for feedback from fellow classmates.<br> 
                            <br>Hearing people’s feedback made me more unsure of which concept was the best to run with. Because we cannot decide, we will continue working with all three concepts for our initial sketches to narrow down the best ideas in future.<br>

                    <br>Benjie, Nathan and I used the tutorial to try to decide on which idea we wanted to run with. We deliberated for a while about it and spoke to others about which ideas they liked better. Most people turned towards the Secure Housing Bus. We talked to Sophie about it and she mentioned to just pick whichever idea we like the most or whatever one would be the most fun or interesting to design. My favourites were the Utility Bot and Secure Housing Bus, but even then I thought both had their pros and cons. The Secure Housing Bus is an obvious solution as it was the first idea that we thought of before we had even done any research. I liked the Utility Bot because it was something that was only thought of after doing our research and using different techniques to really flesh out our ideas. I thought it solved a lot of interesting problems, e.g. “Tafe on wheels”, but Secure Housing Bus always came out on top with solving our specific user needs.<br>
                    <br>We discussed our next steps for the week. I will be drawing a site map and initial sketches of the maintenance cart (which we have now called Utility Bot) and the Secure Housing Bus.<br>
