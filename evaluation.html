                <p class="center-text">After putting together our research reports, Benjie, Nathan and I met up to discuss our findings, combine our affinity diagrams and work further towards a final concept or idea we could work with.<br>
                    <br>It turns out sifting through research was harder than I thought. We originally drew up a diagram that was a little messy and confusing to try and link up all of our research, so instead we refined what groups of people were involved with domestic violence. We first broke it down into four main categories: Police, Support Groups, Victims and Government. We then looked at different aspects within each of these categories. We discussed which area we wanted to focus on and immediately ruled out Government as there would be no access to do so. Victims would also be a difficult group to access. We discussed how Police are only involved at the very start of the process, and dealing with domestic violence is only a very small part of what they do. We generally agreed Support would be a good area to focus on as it is easily accessible and there are a lot of aspects to it. It is also where I have done all of my research, so it is what I am most comfortable with.<br>

                    <br>Another part of our process was looking at our persona’s. We wrote down basic points about each and discussed them with each other. This helped us to empathise with each other and hone down on solutions.<br>                    
                    <br>We then brainstormed a few concepts as a starting point. These ideas were pretty straightforward and I found it quite difficult to come up with any good ideas on the spot.<br>                    
                    <br>We talked to Sophie to get some feedback and find out whether we were on the right track. She advised us that doing forced associations would be really beneficial as that would make us come up with several ideas. We then decided we would take 6 stakeholders, and 20 autonomous vehicles and generate 20 ideas each. This would help us to come up with as many ideas as possible, good or bad.<br>
                    <br>At first it was really hard to come up with 20 autonomous vehicles, but after googling vehicles I managed to come up with them all. I got my cards ready and smashed out the activity in about 10 minutes. I would put down the first idea that came to my head for each one, trying not to think about it too hard. Some of them were terrible, others were ok.<br>
                    <br>We then collated our concepts that were generated from our forced associations. Collectively, we came up with 60 ideas. It was interesting to see how many of our ideas were repeated. That didn’t necessarily mean they were better ideas, but that they were maybe the easiest to come up with.<br> 
                    <br>We went around and picked our favourite ideas from each person’s 20. This gave us 3 ideas each and 9 ideas in total. We then crossed off our least favourite ideas from the collection of 9. And again, another 3. This left us with our 3 strongest ideas. Ideally, we would have liked to get down to 2, but we could not decide between them, and considering there were three of us, it made sense for us to take an idea each and further explore it. The great thing was all three ideas were very different from each other and went down different avenues.<br>
                   
                   
                    <br>To take the ideas one step further we used the ‘Brainwriting 6-3-5’ technique. This is where we write three ideas at the top of page, pass the paper around and the next person expands on or amends the idea. You time it and continue this for everyone in the group. I thought brainstorming was a pointless thing to do and I didn’t really get what benefit it would give us. By the end of it I was amazed at how useful it was. I was worried that under pressure I wouldn’t be able to think of anything. I ended up coming up with a bunch of ideas during the brain writing session while under time pressure, that I may not have been able to come up with otherwise. It forced me to think really hard about what could be done to improve, add to or change our current concepts.
