                <p class="center-text">I had a look through the “Design. Think. Make. Break. Repeat.” book to review different techniques I could use to collect and analyse research data. I decided on conducting semi-structured interviews and contextual observations of the work environment of social workers who provide housing services for victims of domestic violence. Benjie got me in touch with the people at Newtown Neighbourhood Centre and I started to get together my research plan.<br>
                    <br> I wrote up my research plan so I could get a clear focus on what my objective was going to be:</p>  
                <p class="center-text indent-text">The overall goal is to understand factors involved in domestic violence in Sydney. I want to find out details about the process involved and technologies used when victims of domestic violence seek help. I hope to gain an insight into the workings of social workers and crisis centres when it comes to helping those who need, for example, housing or counselling, as a result of leaving a violent domestic situation.</p>       
                <p class="center-text">Coming up with the right interview questions was important. I needed to ask questions about the workers and their experience, but I also wanted to find out the perspective of victims as best as I could through them, given that I am not able to speak to them myself. <br>

                <p class="center-text">I was originally interviewing a social worker who worked at Newtown Neighbourhood Centre but she ended up pulling out at the last minute as she misunderstood what my research was for and did not feel comfortable talking to me. As a result, I no longer had anyone to interview. I then had another social worker there inform me that there were a couple of people at the workplace that would be willing to speak with me. Luckily, I could still go ahead with my interviews the next day. <br></p>

                  <p class="center-text"> 
                    <br>When I arrived, I met with the Service Manager there. He was happy to be interviewed and told me about his experience there. His main role was dealing with homeless people. As many people who are victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence end up homeless, this would be a valuable person to speak with. <br></p>

               As it was my first interview, I wasn’t sure how it would go. In the end, I ended up asking a lot of questions, including ones that I hadn’t written down. He showed me the different programs and apps that they used and explained to me the problems faced by the workers and people who apply for housing applications. He told me how important safety was and how not well off these people who needed housing were. The conversation unexpectedly went towards discussing perpetrators as well as victims. He told me how perpetrators were a large number of clients of his as they too can be in need of housing. This is because many of them will end up in prison and once they return from prison are left with nothing. It was really interesting to get that perspective, because with domestic violence, you usually only focus on the victim. It made me realise that there is a lot of work that needs to be done in educating perpetrators and getting them help to improve their behaviours and getting their lives back on track.<br>

                <br>While I was at Newtown Neighbourhood Centre another lady was willing to have an interview with me. She had experience working for the Salvation Army Safe House and we had a good conversation about what it’s like being a victim there are well as a social worker dealing with people in that situation. <br> </p>

                    Overall, I think the interviews went very well. I gained a lot of insight into their world, and by effect, the world of those seeking help from domestic violence. There were three main groups of people that I would now be looking at: victims, social workers, and perpetrators. <br>    
                    <br> After the interviews, I transcribed the data and highlighted the main points. Given I only had two interviews, there was a lot that came out of it. I followed this up with an affinity diagram to figure out the main needs.</p>
