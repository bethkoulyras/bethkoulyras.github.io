It obvious it needed a navigation page so the user could know where they are and where they’re gong. Safety was the main importance so I created a safety page. I also wanted the user to be able to chat to counsellors or start applying for housing applications, so added a ‘Services’ page. I also thought the user would need to be able to find out things about the bus, like where the food is stored, what supplies they have access to - a kind of manual for the house, so created an ‘About’ page. I went through many iterations of what I thought the base design should look like considering all these things that were necessary.</p>

The first thing I noticed was that I hated the horizontal scrolling. I started to think about why Netflix designers thought it was a good idea to horizontal scroll because it felt so much more difficult to search for content and limited what I could see. The one thing I liked about it was the auto trailers that displayed at the top of the screen and I soon realised that that wouldn’t be possible without that kind of scrolling. It allowed room for other important content to be seen at the same time and it also allowed the user to focus on information in smaller chunks rather than an overload of content across the whole screen. I then thought how perfect that would actually be for the in-bus interface and implemented it into my own design. I created a sidebar of icons pertaining to different information. I made my screens have horizontal scrolling so I could display information, for example, about safety, at the top of the display. I wanted the user to only have to focus on one things at a time, they could swipe through to find the page they were looking for, reading through each one as they go, not feeling overhauled with information.

The first pages would be the user logging in and searching for what they need. The task of narrowing down what they needed needed to be simple and straightforward. Each step of the task would then be displayed one screen at a time. There would be a page to learn about the different tools in the cart. It would also be important to be able to return the cart at any point in time.</p>

                    Benjie, Nathan and I met up in the tutorial to show each other our sketches and provide feedback. We each presented what we had done in hopes of figuring out which idea we thought was the best. I only focused on the in-bus system whereas Benjie had only focused on the app, which was good because we had unintentionally worked on different aspects of the same design. The same thing with the maintenance cart, I had worked on the in-cart display and Nathan had worked on the app. By the end of it, we weren’t ready to decide on an idea and given there were three of us, decided to do further wireframing and testing on one idea each. I felt most attached to the Secure Housing Bus idea so I chose to work on that one. Benjie will do the Office Assistant and Nathan will do the Maintenance Cart. Sophie also came and talked to us, provided some feedback and told us what we should be doing next.
