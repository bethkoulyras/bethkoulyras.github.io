                <p class="center-text">It was now time to digitise the wireframes I had done. I created the basic layout of the split screen and first off downloaded all of the icons I needed off the Noun project and flaticon.com. I felt pretty good with icons I selected, the trickiest one to decide upon was the window one, but after talking to Nathan about it, we decided the side window was best.<br>

                    <br>The biggest changes I made was adding text to the icons, and changing the ‘adjust settings’ button to an ellipsis, in the hopes that it would become more recognisable. I wanted to make it obvious that in the windows tab, you could select and deselect on the different icons to activate the auto settings of those functions. The navigation button turned into a simple search button that came up with preset locations.<br>

                    <p><br>We tested the final iteration of wireframes on 8 different people. I used the Marvel app again but put the interface on a computer rather than an iPad this time. This was because the screen was larger and more in line with what the realistic screen size may actually be. It was also less glitchy, I found the mobile and iPad versions to have a few problems, but this was resolved on the web.<br>

                        <br>The results were pretty similar but there were a few issues that arose. People still seemed to get confused the first time they were asked to change the temperature, which suggested maybe the ellipsis was not necessarily the best option either. What I noticed it came down to was the communication of the task between us and the participants. It was not very clear at first that the user needed to change the degrees of the air conditioner, so many people thought the options were already on the quick controls and they did not need to go into the extra settings. What I found worked best was there was no longer any confusion about what icons were what.<br>
