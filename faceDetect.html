            After our research, we came across an interesting problem – while these campaigns would bring about great awareness, in the end they had a low impact. We soon found that designing for marginalised people is rather complex and risks trivialisation when they are not a direct part of the process. Trying to solve a complex problem with a simple solution might not be the best approach.</p>
          <p class="text-left">We decided to look at things from a new perspective. From further research, we came up with four key factors to consider when designing for marginalised and disadvantaged communities. We needed to create an artefact that:</p>
