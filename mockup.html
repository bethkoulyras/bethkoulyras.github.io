                <p class="center-text">The next part of the process was to create a mock up of our interfaces with some changes from what we had learnt from previous testing. The first thing Benjie, Nathan and I discussed was what program we were going to use to make this. We wanted a prototyping program that was easy to make animations on, but where we also had ultimate control. Framer seemed like a good solution to this and all of us already had it on our computers. I was also really keen to learn a new program and programming language and I felt like this was the opportunity to do so.<br>

                    <br>After speaking with a few tutors to get their opinion on good prototyping programs, they all suggested proto.io. This required no coding and was quite easy to learn and use. Sophie told us it probably wasn’t the best idea to learn Framer as it was a lot more complex and we would need more than a week to learn it and do it well. After hearing this, I decided to watch some youtube tutorials of both programs to decide for myself which one to use. Up until this stage, I was really keen to learn Framer, so I needed some more convincing not to do so.<br>
                    
                    <br>After watching some videos, I thought Framer might actually be pretty manageable, after all, the interactions I was making were fairly straightforward and I managed to find tutorials on a lot of the animations I wanted to use. I discussed with the others my intention to use Framer, even though it went against what tutors had recommended to us (I now regret this decision greatly).<br>
                    
                    <br>So we agreed we would be using Framer for both the app and in bus interfaces. Nathan would be working on the app and me and Benjie would split up the design and coding of the in bus interface.<br>
                    
                    <br>When it came to working on it, me and Benjie realised it would be too difficult to work on different parts of the coding and design, and it would just waste more time if both of us had to learn a new language. As a result, we decided Benjie would work on the design and I would work on the coding.<br> 
                    
                    <br>The mockup had a few changes from the high-fidelity wireframes. The main difference was changing the ellipsis symbol to an actual written word saying ‘More’. This was suggested to us by Sophie (thanks) and I think it really removed any confusion now about what that button would do.<br>
                    
                    <br>From here came the many many hours of slugging through Framer and realising that it was much more difficult than I had originally realised. I was confident going in, but as I I needed more and more complex interactions, I realised how I had underestimated it. I persisted though, and managed to complete it to the best I could given the timeframe. Even though I struggled through it, I am glad I got to learn a big program that many people use for prototyping and I know I’ll be able to use it a lot easier now in the future.<br>
                    
                    <br>After completing the mockup, there is always further testing that can be done to improve it. As for now, here is the full mockup of the in-bus interface:<br>
